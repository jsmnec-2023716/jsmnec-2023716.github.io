                Even though I've never had a cat, I would consider myself a cat person. But did you know that <br> people are allergic to cats because of their saliva and not their fur? It's because cats cover themselves in their saliva <br> in order to clean themselves and that is what makes people allergic to it. The more you know!!

                Fun fact: I didn't know that about cats until today. My friend's little brother told me while I was at her house. <br> I just thought that that was interesting to think about so I wanted to share that here :)
